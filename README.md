# PyBer Analysis
# Challenge
In this challenge, my task is to determine if there is a correlation between the average fare and the total rides for each city type and if there is any statistical significance between the different city types.

In addition to the scatter and pie charts created in Pyber analysis, I included a summary table of key metrics of the ride-sharing data by city type, and a multiple-line graph that shows the average fare for each week by each city type.

- Summary Table

This table showcases Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride, and Average Fare per Driver for each city type (Rural, Suburban, Urban) from the Pyber database. As shown in the table, the total number of rides and drivers are relatively low for rural areas and steadily increase as we go to heavier-traffic areas such as suburban and urban. The total number of rides for urban cities is 13 times as much as rural cities and the total driver count of urban cities is aprroximately 31 times more than rural's. Meanwhile, total fares for urban is merely 9 times as much as rural's. This consequently leads to lower averages for urban. Rural's average fare per driver is $55.49, which is almost 3.34 times as much as urban's.

 she would like to see a summary table of key metrics of the ride-sharing data by city type, and a multiple-line graph that shows the average fare for each week by each city type.
Write a summary in your README.md file for the data in the summary DataFrame.
Write a summary in your README.md file on what the multiple line graph tells you about the fares for each city type over time.
