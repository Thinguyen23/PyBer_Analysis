# PyBer Analysis
# Challenge
In this challenge, my task is to determine if there is a correlation between the average fare and the total rides for each city type and if there is any statistical significance between the different city types.

In addition to the scatter and pie charts created in Pyber analysis, I included a summary table of key metrics of the ride-sharing data by city type, and a multiple-line graph that shows the total fare for each week by each city type.

- **Summary Table**

This table showcases Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride, and Average Fare per Driver for each city type (Rural, Suburban, Urban) from the Pyber database. As shown in the table, the total number of rides and drivers are relatively low for rural areas and steadily increase as we go to heavier-traffic areas such as suburban and urban. The total number of rides for urban cities is 13 times as much as rural cities and the total driver count of urban cities is aprroximately 31 times more than rural's. Meanwhile, total fares for urban is merely 9 times as much as rural's. This consequently leads to lower averages for urban. Rural's average fare per driver is $55.49, which is almost 3.34 times as much as urban's. This might imply an overallocation of drivers in urban areas. 

Although rural's total fares is relatively low as compared to suburban and urban, average fare per ride and average fare per driver are the highest among city types. Rural cities might not be the most popular choice for drivers, but it is proven to be the most profitable in terms of fare per ride. 


- **Total Fare for Each Week by Each City Type**

This graph illustrates the total fare for each week from 01/01/2019 to 04/28/2019 by each city type. Rural's fare is in blue; suburban's is red; and urban's is in mustard. Total fare for all city type fluctuates in similar pattern which starts low in January and early February, and starts rising in late February to April. As shown in the graph, the total fare for rural cities remains lower than total fare for suburban, which is far less than urban's for the entire period. Rural's weekly fare ranges roughly from $0 to $500, suburban's from $750 to $1500 and urban's from $1800 to approximately $2700. At many points, urban's fare is more than 5 times as much as rural's. In terms of profit wide, urban cities generate the highest revenue, which can be explained by the larger population and busier traffic.
