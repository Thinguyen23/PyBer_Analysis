# PyBer Analysis
# Challenge
In this analysis, I try to determining if there is a correlation between the average fare and the total rides for each city type for the individual scatter plots, and if there is any statistical significance between the different city types for each box-and-whisker plot.

Youâ€™ve been asked by your CEO to create an overall snapshot of the ride-sharing data. In addition to your scatter and pie charts, she would like to see a summary table of key metrics of the ride-sharing data by city type, and a multiple-line graph that shows the average fare for each week by each city type.

 she would like to see a summary table of key metrics of the ride-sharing data by city type, and a multiple-line graph that shows the average fare for each week by each city type.
Write a summary in your README.md file for the data in the summary DataFrame.
Write a summary in your README.md file on what the multiple line graph tells you about the fares for each city type over time.
