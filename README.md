# PyBer Analysis
# Challenge
In this challenge, my task is to determining if there is a correlation between the average fare and the total rides for each city type and if there is any statistical significance between the different city types.

In addition to the scatter and pie charts created in Pyber analysis, I included a summary table of key metrics of the ride-sharing data by city type, and a multiple-line graph that shows the average fare for each week by each city type.

- Summary Table

This table showcases Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride, and Average Fare per Driver for each city type (Rural, Suburban, Urban) from the Pyber database. As shown in the table, the total number of rides and drivers are relatively low for rural cities and steadily increase as we go to heavier-traffic areas such as suburban and urban cities.

 she would like to see a summary table of key metrics of the ride-sharing data by city type, and a multiple-line graph that shows the average fare for each week by each city type.
Write a summary in your README.md file for the data in the summary DataFrame.
Write a summary in your README.md file on what the multiple line graph tells you about the fares for each city type over time.
